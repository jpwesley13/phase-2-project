# Monster Match

Monster Match is an application which displays a list of monsters that have been sighted and added to the app by users. Inherently the app allows the user to complete a form to add additional monster sightings to the app. The Monster Match app also allows users to explore other pages to see monsters by their origin series, as well as by location, as a means of seeking the monsters out themselves.

## Initialization

When Monster Match is loaded, the user is greeted with the home page, which explains the app's purpose, in addition to providing them with a form to add new monster sightings. Below the form, the home page displays cards for existing monster sightings.

## Features

* User may freely explore the home page and view a myriad of monster sightings from across the globe and beyond.
* By utilizing the form on the front page, the user can add their own monster sightings to the app.
* The user can click on an observations link for any displayed monster to obtain additional information.
* In addition to the Home tab, tabs for Series and Travel allow the user to filter down monsters by various criteria.

## Monster Sightings

Every confirmed monster sighting is represented by a graphical card on the app's home page. This card displays the monster's name and the image associated with its sighting, along with a link to observations on the monster.

## New Sighting

On the home page of the app, the user may submit a form to add a new monster sighting to the page. The user enters information on the monster's name, series of origin, and provides a link to an image of the sighting. Additionally the user uses drop down menus on the form to confirm the location, risk factor, and rarity of the sighting. Upon the form's submission, the monster is immediately added to the home page.

## Observations

By clicking the `Observations` link on a displayed monster's card, a user is directed to a page for that specific monster. This page features all known information on the monster, which includes its name, series of origin, location of first sighting, risk to humans, and how rare it is. 

## Series and Travel

By using navigation tabs at the top of the app, the user can access the Series and Travel pages. Both of these pages serve as a way for users to filter monsters by respective criteria. In the Series tab, the user is able to use a drop down menu of all unique series associated with the confirmed monster sightings, and will be given a list of only the monsters featured in that series. 

Similarly the Travel page will filter and display lists of monsters, but will do so by a menu of unique locations associated with confirmed monster sightings. This page serves as a travel guide of sorts for the user. Both Series and Travel pages display the risk level of displayed monsters as a way of keeping the user wary should they wish to use these pages to plan future encounters and sightings.
