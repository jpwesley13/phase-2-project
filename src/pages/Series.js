//I want to create a card template for each series. It'd be cool if they had their own logos but for this project I think I'd better not.

//By default there should be a search bar or filter option to find monsters by series. A filter option is cool, but I am unsure if I can make it dynamic to newly added series or not. If so, I definitely want to do it this way.
